# Terminal-Poker
This is a simple application that allows a user to play Texas Hold'em against the program from the command line. The user can choose how many players they 
would like to play against. 

Throughout the course of the game, cards are displayed as a text string with the format: "|\<rank>\<suit>|". 

For example, the hand:
"|KS|  |QC|  |JC|  |10H|  |4D|" would correspond to a hand of the King of Spades, the Queen of Clubs, the Jack of Clubs, the 10 of Hearts, and the 4 of Diamonds.

Standard Texas Hold'em Rules apply, which can be found [here](https://www.pokernews.com/poker-rules/texas-holdem.htm). At the end of each game, the user can 
choose to play again or stop playing.
